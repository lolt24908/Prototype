        <p id="The-opening">Hey guys , my name is Yusuf i'm 18 years old and i'm from Morocco , i know exciting we have nice beaches and amazing food exotic places to visit, but i'm not gonna keep rambling about my country i'm here to talk about more about khan academy ! , first off , this amazing idea of having free education to all people around the world is incredible, it helped me soooooooo much in my studies in university, i discovered it in 2015 altough i was a bit skeptical , i mean to be honest our whole "Society" is skeptical , so i was asking myself some questions , some stuff along the lines of "How can i be sure this is legit?" , "what if this kinda stuff isn't compatible with my classes and programms?", and then i stoped worrying about , and actually said to myself , <strong>math</strong> is <strong>math</strong>
and <strong>physics</strong> are <strong>physics</strong> , i'll try it if it works it works if it doesn't well it'll be a nice new experience , so i the first video i watched was a Calculus video about multi-variable function with 3blue1brown doing the magic work he always does (btw love uuuu dude keep up the goood work) and then went to sal with his limits and derivatives and all bunch of cool stuff , and then the addiction kicked in, altough i have other websites to help (i'm saying this because our school system is conducted with the french language you know the whole colinization part and stuff left a mess here so we are stuck with it) , but i always found khan academy being alot better at making me learn the intuition and then making sense of things , rather than just having some sort of algorithms in my head so that i'll use them to be able to solve problems , so yeah that's my story with khan academy , the best way to learn :D.</p>
<p id="Projekt"> Tomorrow i might ask my teacher if i can rebuild/redesign with the administration's permission of course the university's webpage i will be linking it here for you guys to help me pick some colors or some designs :D <strong>*fingers-crossed*</strong>.</p>
